Technology to the World


Technology is something
People's desire is this one thing
The innovation and improvement
Makes the world a better place

Before the new times
Old were the life
Where people gathered and hunted
Till their life ended

Then they got tired of this
Built farms, then houses, then communities
Systems were made for the population
So people can't go without administration

It's still tedious though
So people thought up of something
Then here came the word automation
Which started the new revolution

People tried to their best 
Automating everything without rest
From farming to publishing
They made everything fast like lightning

This is the starting point of technology
Where we continue to build upon
Where we make stuff like a phone
And most likely continue to exist with odyssey
