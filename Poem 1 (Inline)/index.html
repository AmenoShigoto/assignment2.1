Designing something makes it beautiful<br>
Before, art is used in real life<br>
Now people are online<br>
So graphics, the sibling of art, represents design<br>
<br>
Graphics are often misunderstood<br>
Video games' not only their use<br>
Internet as a whole uses it<br>
Life is basically surrounded by it<br>

Internet exists to be filled with content<br>
Creativity is needed for its intent<br>
Graphics' importance is immense<br>
Internet can't be beautiful without graphic design's help<br>
<br>
Marketing uses graphics as well<br>
People are grabbed by a beautiful design<br>
Emphasizing people's desire<br>
Effective marketing really uses efficient infographics<br>
<br>
What a fascinating invention it is<br>
Beauty can't be seen without graphics<br>
Hoping to improve further than this<br>
Is what can make the future more crisp<br>
