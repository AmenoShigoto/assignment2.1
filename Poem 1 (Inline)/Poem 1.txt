An Ode to Graphics


Designing something makes it beautiful
Before, art is used in real life
Now people are online
So graphics, the sibling of art, represents design

Graphics are often misunderstood
Video games' not only their use
Internet as a whole uses it
Life is basically surrounded by it 

Internet exists to be filled with content
Creativity is needed for its intent
Graphics' importance is immense
Internet can't be beautiful without graphic design's help

Marketing uses graphics as well
People are grabbed by a beautiful design
Emphasizing people's desire
Effective marketing really uses efficient infographics

What a fascinating invention it is
Beauty can't be seen without graphics
Hoping to improve further than this
Is what can make the future more crisp
